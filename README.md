# Stock Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the application of linear regression to predict stock prices. Utilizing historical stock data, the model predicts the closing prices based on several input features such as the opening price, high, low, previous dayâ€™s close, and volume. This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for the entire project.
